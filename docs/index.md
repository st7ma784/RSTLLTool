## What is this tool?

This application was specifically created to address the challenges in reengineering RST code that processes SuperDARN data. The main problem it solves is converting linked-list data structures (which drop items at each processing stage) into large arrays with drop masks to enable efficient parallel processing.

## Key Features

### üîç **Intelligent Code Analysis**
- Automatic detection of linked lists and nested structures
- Real-time parsing of C++ source files
- Memory usage pattern analysis

### üìä **Interactive Matrix Visualization**
- 2D matrix representation of data structures
- Color-coded cells showing active, dropped, pointer, and empty states
- Step-by-step execution visualization

### ‚ö° **Optimization Recommendations**
- Automated suggestions for parallel processing
- Array-based refactoring proposals
- Memory optimization strategies

### üíª **Code Generation**
- Automatic generation of array mapping code
- OpenMP parallel processing templates
- Migration helper functions

## Use Cases

### Primary: RST/SuperDARN Data Processing
- Convert legacy linked-list based processing pipelines
- Identify parallelization opportunities in radar data processing
- Optimize memory allocation patterns for large datasets

### Secondary: General C++ Development
- Educational tool for understanding data structure performance
- Code review assistance for identifying optimization opportunities
- Performance analysis for data-intensive applications
