# Getting Started

This guide will help you quickly start using the C++ Data Structure Visualizer to analyze your code and identify parallel processing opportunities.

## Prerequisites

- C++ source files (.cpp, .c, .h, .hpp, .cc, .cxx)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Step 1: Upload Your Code

1. **Access the Application**: Navigate to the main interface
2. **Upload Files**: Use the drag-and-drop area in the left panel or click "Drop C++ files here"
3. **File Support**: The tool accepts all standard C++ file extensions
4. **Multiple Files**: You can upload multiple files to analyze different components

## Step 2: Select and Analyze

1. **Choose a File**: Click on any uploaded file in the project explorer
2. **Configure Analysis**: Set your analysis preferences:
   - ✅ Detect memory leaks
   - ✅ Analyze drop patterns
   - ⚪ Suggest optimizations
   - ✅ Generate array mappings
3. **Start Analysis**: Click the "Start Analysis" button

## Step 3: Explore the Results

### Matrix Visualization
- **Green cells**: Active data nodes
- **Red cells**: Dropped/deleted nodes
- **Blue cells**: Pointer references
- **Gray cells**: Empty memory slots

### Code Navigation
- Use the step controls to walk through code execution
- Watch the matrix update in real-time
- See how data structures change over time

### Analysis Results
Check the bottom panel for:
- **Structure Summary**: Detected linked lists and nested structures
- **Performance Metrics**: Memory usage and efficiency statistics
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommendations for parallel processing

## Step 4: Generate Array Mappings

1. **Navigate to Array Mapping tab** in the analysis results
2. **Review generated code** for converting structures to arrays
3. **Copy the code** to implement in your project
4. **Use the parallel processing templates** with OpenMP

## Common Use Cases

### Converting Linked Lists
Perfect for RST/SuperDARN data processing where you need to:
- Replace linked lists with contiguous arrays
- Implement drop masks instead of actual deletions
- Enable parallel processing with OpenMP

### Memory Optimization
Identify opportunities to:
- Reduce memory fragmentation
- Improve cache locality
- Minimize allocation overhead

## Next Steps

- Read the [User Guide](user-guide.md) for detailed feature explanations
- Check the [API Reference](api-reference.md) for integration options
- Review [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) to understand the tool's design

## Troubleshooting

### File Upload Issues
- Ensure files have valid C++ extensions
- Check file size (keep under 1MB for best performance)
- Try uploading one file at a time if experiencing issues

### Analysis Problems
- Verify C++ syntax is valid
- Complex template code may not be fully parsed
- Focus on struct/class definitions for best results

### Performance Tips
- Start with smaller files to understand the interface
- Use the step controls to follow execution flow
- Pay attention to the efficiency percentage in statistics
